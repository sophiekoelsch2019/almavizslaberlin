        <h1>HELLO <sup>MY</sup> <sub>NAME</sub> <sup>IS</sup> ALMA</h1>
            I am a vizsla puppy living in Berlin, Charlottenburg. 
            My mommys name is Emily and my daddys name is Steffen. 
            I also have two aunties named Stella and Sophie and an uncle named Sebastian.
            I love them so much that I have to annoy them all day every day. Thats my passion.
            Also, I have the coolest dog friends Balu (he's like my big brother, teaching me
            all the cool things in life), Ruby my almost-twin sister, Henry the big ear guy 
            and Whiskey the tiny ball of black furr. I am just a happy kid enjoying life to 
            the fullest.

        <h1>More about Vizla-dogs:</h1>    
        Created in Hungary to work as a pointer and retriever, the Vizsla 
        dog breed has an aristocratic bearing. All he really wants, though, 
        is to be loved. He‚Äôs a super companion for an active family who can
